create a synopsis.md file at the root of the Taylors project
that can be generated with a standard instruction "generate synopsis" defined in .opencode, the synopsis.md should contain 
a bullet point shortlist of most recent updates to highest priority tasks

need another recurring.md file at the root that can be generated with a standard
instruction "generate recurring" that pulls all recurring tasks with a todo date this week 
and leaves space to input the outcome, resulting tasks (and which directory they fall under),
and the time until the next occurance. 

once recurring.md is populated there should be an instruction file for automatically taking the
recurring task updates and creating an update object in each corresponding taskfile, creating new
tasks from the "resulting_tasks" and updating the next_occurance field for each recurring task
based on the specified time until next occurance
